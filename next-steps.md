# Next Steps for Miro MCP Server Enhancement

## Current Challenge

LLMs and agentic AI tools currently struggle with modifying existing elements on Miro boards, defaulting to creating new elements rather than updating existing ones. This happens because:

1. LLMs lack easy ways to find relevant existing elements by their content or meaning
2. The overhead of searching through all elements is high
3. Creation paths are typically simpler than modification paths
4. LLMs don't maintain sufficient context about previously created elements

## Proposed Solutions

### 1. Content-Based Search Tools

Create dedicated search functionality to find elements by their content:

```typescript
// Example API
search_elements_by_content(
  query: string,         // Text to search for
  type?: string,         // Optional filter by item type
  fuzzy_match?: boolean  // Whether to use exact or fuzzy matching
): Element[]
```

This would enable prompts like "find the sticky note about user feedback and change its color to blue" to work effectively.

### 2. Semantic Search Capabilities

Implement vector embeddings to find elements by semantic similarity:

```typescript
find_similar_elements(
  description: string,   // Semantic description of what to find
  max_results?: number   // Maximum number of results to return
): Element[]
```

This would help when the LLM has an approximate idea of what element needs modification.

### 3. Modification-First Workflow Helpers

Add tools that encourage a modification-first approach:

```typescript
find_and_modify(
  content_query: string,
  modification_function: (element: Element) => Element
): Result

update_matching_elements(
  content_pattern: string | RegExp,
  new_properties: Partial<ElementProperties>
): Result
```

### 4. Enhanced Element Summarization

When returning board state, include concise content summaries for text-based elements:

```json
{
  "id": "123",
  "type": "sticky_note",
  "content_summary": "User feedback about login page",
  "position": {...}
}
```

This makes it easier for LLMs to identify relevant elements amid complex board state.

### 5. Content-Based ID Aliases

Implement an alias system allowing LLMs to refer to elements by their content:

```typescript
modify_element_by_content(
  content_reference: string,   // E.g., "the feedback sticky note"
  properties: Partial<ElementProperties>
): Result
```

### 6. History-Aware Board State

Maintain history awareness in returned board state:

```json
{
  "items": [...],
  "recently_modified": [
    {"id": "123", "content_summary": "User feedback", "last_modified": "timestamp"}
  ],
  "recently_created": [
    {"id": "456", "content_summary": "New feature", "created_at": "timestamp"}
  ]
}
```

### 7. Spatial Context Tools

Create tools that analyze specific board regions:

```typescript
describe_elements_at_position(
  x: number,
  y: number,
  radius: number
): Element[]
```

### 8. Duplication Detection

Add validation that warns when the LLM is creating potentially duplicate content:

```typescript
check_for_similar_content(
  new_content: string,
  item_type: string
): {
  duplicates_found: boolean,
  similar_items: Element[]
}
```

## Implementation Priority

1. **Content-based search** (highest impact, moderate implementation effort)
2. **Enhanced element summarization** (high impact, low implementation effort)
3. **History awareness** (high impact, low implementation effort)
4. **Duplication detection** (moderate impact, moderate effort)
5. **Semantic search** (high impact, higher implementation effort)

## Integration Approach

These features should be implemented as extensions to the existing tools rather than creating many new ones, given tool limits:

1. Enhance `get_complete_board` with content summaries and history awareness
2. Add content search parameters to `list_board_items`
3. Add a `find_by_content` option to existing item operation tools
4. Include duplication warnings in item creation workflows

## Next Immediate Actions

1. Implement basic content-based search in the `list_board_items` tool
2. Add content summarization to `get_complete_board` and `get_item_tree` responses
3. Create a simple history tracker for recently modified/created items
4. Document these capabilities clearly in tool descriptions to guide LLM usage
